# DIeSEL
DIeSEL (Distributed Self-Localization of a network of vehicles) algorithm, with a simple example.

Author: Pusheng Ji

Run main.m routine for an example. The algorithm is present at diesel.m. 
The algorithm file is commented. Read the file carefully in order to determine the structure of the stacks.
The stopping criterion is set at fixed iterations, but can be easily adapted for minimum improvement criterion.

For any questions or bugs contact me.
